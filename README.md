## **Overview**

**Game of Life Extendi** implements Conway's *Game of Life* as an API-only Rails application. It uses Rails 8 for the backend. The project is Docker-ready for easy local development and production deployment.

---

## **Features**

- **API-Only**: No views or controllers for HTML â€” all data is served via JSON responses.
- **Conway's Game of Life**: Implements next-generation logic and resetting functionality.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Simplified setup using Docker Compose.

---

## **Code Structure**

### **Model**

#### **GameState**
- **Responsibility**: Represents the state of the game grid for a specific user.
- **Attributes**:
  - `generation` - Tracks the current generation of the game.
  - `rows` - Number of rows in the grid.
  - `cols` - Number of columns in the grid.
  - `state` - A 2D array representing the game grid (`*` for alive, `.` for dead).
  - `alived_cells_count` - Count of alive cells in the grid.
  - `initial_file_data` - Stores the initial game state for reset functionality.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `next_generation!` - Advances the game state to the next generation using the `GameStateProgressionService`.
  - `restore_initial_state!` - Restores the game state to its original configuration.
- **Callbacks**:
  - `process_file` - Parses the uploaded file and initializes game state attributes.
  - `validate_file_type` - Ensures that the uploaded file is a `.txt` file.
  - `update_alived_cells_count` - Calculates the number of alive cells before saving.
  - `store_initial_file_data` - Saves the initial state for restoration.


### **Controller**

#### **GameStatesController**
- **Responsibility**: Manages game states for Conway's *Game of Life*.
- **Key Actions**:
  - `index` - Lists all game states.
  - `show` - Displays the details of a specific game state.
  - `new` - Renders a form to upload a new game state.
  - `create` - Processes and saves a new game state from a `.txt` file.
  - `next_generation` - Advances the game state to the next generation.
  - `reset_to_initial` - Resets the game state to its initial configuration.
  - `destroy` - Deletes a game state and redirects to the index page.

---

### **Services**

#### **GameStateUploadService**
- **Purpose**: Parses and validates uploaded `.txt` files to initialize game states.
- **Logic**:
  - Extracts the generation, grid dimensions, and cell states.
  - Ensures the file content matches expected format and structure.

#### **GameStateProgressionService**
- **Purpose**: Calculates the next generation for the *Game of Life* grid.
- **Logic**:
  - Iterates through each cell to count live neighbors.
  - Applies Conway's rules to determine the cell's next state (alive or dead).
  - Updates the game state and increments the generation counter.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **1. Prerequisites**

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
